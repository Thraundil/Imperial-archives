## Bonus: Terminal-commands for fun and profit!
If you want to use/save any of the following .py programs to your bash:
* 1: Create a bin folder in your home repository (mkdir ~/bin)
* 2: Put files (toHex.py etc) into ~/bin
* 3: Go to your .bashrc (vim ~/.bashrc)
* 4: Add a command, preferably at the end of the file. Example: alias tohex='python bin/toHex.py $1'
* 5: Restart your terminal, and you're done!
